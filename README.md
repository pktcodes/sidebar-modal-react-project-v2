# Sidebar Modal 🗄️

> PROD [Live] : https://react-sidebar-modal-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Sidebar Modal consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Sidebar** button which on click opens a list of hyperlinks to other pages, and social sites along with an SVG image logo *Coding Addict*, and a show **Modal** button which on click opens a pop-up modal. Both sidebar and modal have **`Close`** buttons.
- Page links in sidebar i.e. `Home` is set to the homepage and other page routes have not been set with any data i.e., `Team` , `Projects` , `Calendar` , `Documents` but **Netlify** handles them as *Page not Found* and social icon links have been set to route to their respective official sites.
- Data is handled by **`data.jsx`** and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
